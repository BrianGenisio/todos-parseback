This is an example of using the Parse.com / Backbone.js adapter.

It is an adaptation of the Backbone.js Todos application.  Originally,
it saved to local storage.  This version runs via the Parse.com proxy
and stores data at Parse.com.

To use this:
* Make sure Node.js and NPM are installed
* Make sure coffee-script, express and restler are installed

* copy config.coffee.example config.coffee
* edit config.coffee to include your Parse.com App ID and Master Key
* coffee proxy.coffee
* Point your browser to http://localhost:3001 (or whatever port you have in config.coffee)
